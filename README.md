# pothole-detection
This project aims to detect and segment potholes using the YOLOv8 instance segmentation model. By leveraging deep learning techniques, it enables real-time pothole detection, which can aid in road maintenance and safety. The model is trained on annotated images and can be deployed for automated road inspections
